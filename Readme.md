## Anydata  

### Why  
Let's say we have data from external sources, well, not standard built-in and custom post types, but data, for example, from custom database tables or somewhere else.
But we want to display them in the same way as standard WordPress data.
This is what this plugin was developed for.

### Usecase

Let's imagine that in the database, in addition to the WordPress tables, there is a city table that has 3 fields(id, city, country)
and we want to see them in the grid.
